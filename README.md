# RuneMonk Recorder

![RuneMonk Recorder Logo](/logo.png)

This plugin is used to record a RSREC file and play it back on runemonk.com<br />
This project is still very early in development. The main focus right now is the plugin and making sure the RSREC files work correctly. The player will be improved and updated in the future. RSREC files are designed to be forward compatible so any recordings made now should work in the future. 

<br />

<h2>Recording</h2>

Use the RuneLite sidebar to open the plugin panel and create a recording.
